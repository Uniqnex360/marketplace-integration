LYSOL, Laundry Sanitizer Tropical Escape 6/41 oz	Our clothes are in constant contact with bacteria throughout our day-to-day activities, for example through contact with contaminated surfaces, other people and our own bodies. Bacteria can spread from one fabric to another in the laundry basket, from the washing-machine drum to the next load. Some these bacteria can survive a wash cycle and can cause potential infection risk with pathogenic bacteria. When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want your detergent to eliminate bacteria that can cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria left behind. Simply add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your rinse cycle. It does not contain any bleach and even works in cold water so is safe to use on most fabrics including whites, colors and darks.	0106BFAC7XZ	HYL-8505	17.89	6	2024-01-05 16:05:06 PST		y	1			11				B0CRN6B7LS						B0CRN6B7LS			0	DEFAULT	Migrated Template	Active

LYSOL Laundry Sanitizer Brand New Day Tropical Escape 41 oz (2 PACK)	Our clothes are in constant contact with bacteria throughout our day-to-day activities, for example through contact with contaminated surfaces, other people and our own bodies.

When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want your detergent to eliminate bacteria that can cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria left behind.

Lysol Laundry Sanitizer Additive, Fresh Blossoms, 41oz	Our clothes are in constant contact with bacteria throughout our day-to-day activities, for example through contact with contaminated surfaces, other people and our own bodies. Bacteria can spread from one fabric to another in the laundry basket, from the washing-machine drum to the next load. Some these bacteria can survive a wash cycle and can cause potential infection risk with pathogenic bacteria. When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want your detergent to eliminate bacteria that can cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria left behind. Simply add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your rinse cycle. It does not contain any bleach and even works in cold water so is safe to use on most fabrics including whites, colors and darks.	0109BOMRTFR	MX-OVJ8-7SEX		0	2024-01-09 12:42:36 PST		y	1			11				B0CRWY9MFB						B0CRWY9MFB			0	DEFAULT	Migrated Template	Inactive

Applying the wax: Spread the wax, using the spatula, in the direction of hair growth in thin layers. Immediately place the strip over the layer of wax. Smooth the strip over the wax in the direction of hair growth. Removing the wax: Hold your skin taut. Grip the bottom end of the strip and pull the strip back as quickly as you can, against the direction the hair grows. Pull the strip back on itself, close to the skin rather than away from it. You can re-use each strip even if wax is already stuck to it. But don’t wax over the same area more than once. If you have any residue left on your skin, simply use water to remove it.	0613A5PVTZJ	PB-50009-2PK-FBA	24.99		2023-06-13 15:28:03 PDT		y	1			11				B084JCW6R7						B084JCW6R7				AMAZON_NA	Migrated Template	Inactive
